            <p>
                I have several years of experience working as a Quality Assurance
                Specialist in the software development industry. I have worked with
                companies such as RealPage Inc and Newshore, where I have demonstrated
                my skills in creating comprehensive test plans, writing detailed test
                cases, conducting regression testing and smoke testing, performing API
                testing, reporting bugs and defects, automating tests, and participating
                in agile meetings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout my career, I have gained knowledge and proficiency in a
                variety of testing tools and technologies, including TFS over Azure,
                Soap UI, PostMan, Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber, Swagger, Java, Gherkin,
                JUnit, and IntelliJ.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have a strong focus on ensuring the high quality of software products,
                with experience in both manual and automated testing. I have worked on
                web and mobile applications, and I'm passionate about delivering
                high-quality software products that meet the needs and expectations of
                customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                My attention to detail, strong analytical skills, and ability to work
                effectively in a team environment have been instrumental in my success.
                I have consistently delivered high-quality software products, detected
                and reported bugs and defects in a clear and concise manner, and ensured
                that new features do not cause issues in existing functionality.
                Overall, I am confident that my experience, skills, and achievements
                make me a valuable asset to any team in need of a Quality Assurance
                Specialist.
